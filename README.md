This is a Customer Panel to generate M-PESA Payment QR Codes for any Till/Paybill.

I built this to help individuals/businesses opt consider providing customer payment terminals. Currently the [M-PESA app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safaricom.mpesa.lifestyle&hl=en) is the most used finance app in the Android/iOS appstores.

The 'Scan QR to Pay' feature exists but isn't widely used. I discovered this while shopping in a supermarket and found it faster than keying in the store details or waiting for a payment prompt from the teller.

Discovered it was a simple sequence , built a v1 and now anyone can use this in their business that makes paying for things 3s faster !

Its free , offline and will stay that way.
